# Developing QuestionBot

These are the requirements to develop the bot.

- Git (to clone, can also download .zip)
- JDK version 8+
- IntelliJ IDEA
    - If you are not using IntelliJ IDEA you will need Maven as well.

To create a run config for development you want to use `com.supergrecko.questionbot.QuestionBotKt` as the main file.

There should be a single program argument which is the Discord Bot Token.
